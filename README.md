# 🌾 The Agro Hub — Farmer's Market Platform

A beginner-level hackathon project built during **KIST HackFest 2024**, designed to connect **local farmers** with consumers through a clean and simple web interface.

This project was developed just **2 weeks into our first semester**, and while it's not a complex app, it reflects our early enthusiasm, curiosity, and ability to build and deploy as complete beginners.
